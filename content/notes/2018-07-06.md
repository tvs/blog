# Bi-Weekly SIG Sync - July 6th

## SIG Architecture

* Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA) API - in-tree or CRD?
  * sig-arch is pushing hard to keep new things as CRDs, but current CRD
    capabilities are inadequate for what features require.
  * VPA to stay as CRD and HPA should come out in the future

## SIG Networking

* Discussed that K8s does not support SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
  and a KEP to add it
  * Outstanding issue that SCTP is used via two methods - kernel module and
    userspace - and these two methods are mutually exclusive. Once the
    SCTP kmod is loaded, no userspace SCTP workload can be handled

## SIG Release

* 1.11 released, 1.11.1 is scheduled in the upcoming weeks
  * Bug in priority and preemption
* 1.12 cycle has officially begun, scheduled for 9/25

## SIG Storage

* Snapshot meeting, planning implementation via CRD
  * Architecture turned down effort for it to be a built-in
* CSI inline volumes - Tim H. against moving ConfigMaps and Secrets
  * Volume that doesn't have a PV

## WG IOT Edge

* New WG, joint with Eclipse Foundation and CNCF
* Eclipse has two OSS Hono and Kapua which run on K8s
* Planning a press release to announce group
