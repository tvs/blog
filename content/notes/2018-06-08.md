# K8s SIG-sync Meeting

[Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1juMYauhuyeyayGqGlc18z1iISAR3qGqDsiaWQu2NOBw/edit#heading=h.2j9x6mjcxfd7)

* BOSH and CFCR should deal with cluster-lifecycle SIG (deals with cluster and
  deployment)

## SIG Breakdown

* [API Machinery](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9RNaaysyO0gXHIr1y50QFbiL1x8OWnk2v3XnrdkT5Y/edit)
  * e2e tests and flakes
  * etcd object sizing and how much space that takes in etcd
    * Prediction vs Actual can differ depending on how etcd is being used
    * Suggesting that this be written into etcd docs
  * Dynamic Auditing - looking for reviewers and approvers in SIG-Arch
* [Auth](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1woLGRoONE3EBVx-wTb4pvp4CI7tmLZ6lS26VTbosLKM/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Kube OIDC
  * Dynamic configuration for audit logging (worry about turning off auditing
    in a compromised env)
* [CLI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r0YElcXt6G5mOWxwZiXgGu_X6he3F--wKwg-9UBc29I/edit?usp=sharing)
  * `wait` command added:

    ```
    kubectl wait --for=delete resource/foo
    kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=60s resource-string(deployment)/foo
    ```

* [Cloud Provider](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OZE-ub-v6B8y-GuaWejL-vU_f9jsjBbrim4LtTfxssw/edit#heading=h.w7i4ksrweimp)
  * Discussion on formalizing a proposal (KEP) to standardize the way of building
    CCMs out of tree
* [Community](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY/)
  * KEPs discussed - new emphasis on doing design proposals in community repo
    before coding new features
  * VMware SIG status this week - 4 slide deck
  * Multi-Cluster Status and Networking also presented
* [Contributor Experience](https://goo.gl/fTqjwb)
  * [Non-Code guide meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gdFWfkrapQclZ4-z4Lx2JwqKsJjXXUOVoLhBzZiZgSk/edit?usp=sharing)
      - might be useful to adopt for CFCR
  * Foqal bot - enhances Slack
  * discuss.k8s.io - might move kubernetes-users mailing list there
* [Networking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_w77-zG_Xj0zYvEMfQZTQ-wPP4kXkpGD8smVtW_qqWM/edit)
  * CoreDNS good for GA in 1.11 - KubeDNS deprecation for 1.12, EOL for 1.15
  * Interest in dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) at the edge
      - Full dual stack support targeted for 1.12 (possibly too aggressive)
      - "Should work", but not a long term solution
  * Intel gave demo of device plugin + CNI to overcome CNI shortcomings
      - SRIOV VFs become resources required for scheduling
      - Also built off of Multus
      - Demo successful, but Tim H. unsure if all the gRPC comms happening between
      components are neccessary
  * Ed Wernicke from Cisco gave a demo of Network Service Mesh
      - Alternative to multi-network (Multus)
      - Tim H. disliked the baggage that comes with "mesh"
* [Release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nTywSCM9h-GE360PTRw71vvPMmzt74PloXuhG9znptM/edit)
  * 1.11-beta.2 released
  * 1.10.4 released
  * Currently in code freeze
  * Documentation as a blocker being explored because the lack of docs is growing
  * Looking at moving to a 3x a year release cycle - 4th during December never goes
    well
* [Resource Management](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-resource-management)
  * [CPU pool](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gdFWfkrapQclZ4-z4Lx2JwqKsJjXXUOVoLhBzZiZgSk/edit?usp=sharing)
      - Similar to CPU pinning or CPU affinity
      - Ask for certain "class" of CPU
* [Storage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8KEG8AjAgKznS9NFm3qWqkGyCHmvU6HVl0sk5hwoAE/edit?usp=sharing)
  * 1.11 status discussion
  * Snapshot design discussion
  * CSI v0.3
* [Testing](https://goo.gl/WULgHT)
  * Should long running tests be blocking?
  * Critical issues around the time of 10,000+ nodes that aren't seen at 4- or 5,000
* [VMware](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RV0nVtlPoAtM0DQwNYxYCC9lHfiHpTNatyv4bek6XtA/edit)
  * Discussion whether VCP should be broken off as a WG with invites going out to others
      - Not ready yet
  * SAP presentation on Gardener (Deploy + "Day 2" + K8s on different clouds:
    AWS, GCE, OpenStack)
      - Looking for help adding support with vSphere
  * Potential for CI/CD WG
