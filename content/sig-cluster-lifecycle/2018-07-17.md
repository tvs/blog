# SIG Cluster Lifecycle

* Debian packages are only built for Xenial - wondering when they might support
  others.
* [kube-deploy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy)
  * Intended to be an analogue to the [contrib repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib)
  * Removed the cluster-api code
  * Promoted image builder to the top level, used by kops
  * Should be renamed to describe what it actually does (e.g. image-builder)
    * Builds an image that is intended for use on AWS, used by KOPS by default
  * May have overlap with [wardroom](https://github.com/heptiolabs/wardroom)
* Transfer of ownership to k8s-sigs for [cluser-api-provider-aws](https://github.com/detiber/cluster-api-provider-aws)
  * Skeleton impl of an AWS provider for cluster-api
* SIG Charter
  * Canonically good examples from sig-node and sig-auth
  * Looking for folks to help
* State of testing and cluster - firmer commitments
  * Have talked for awhile about "desired state"
    * Bazel
    * Cluster API (since k8s-anywhere is dead)
    * PR-blocking job for kubeadm deployments
  * Have put off issues and been maintaining large technical debt
  * Some blocking items:
    * Cluster-API as the provisioning tool - something that the SIG maintains
      and there's an owner to be contacted
    * Release and build artifacts - who owns and maintains them
  * Need to address these broadly as a SIG
    * Previously Google owned a lot but needs to be federated
  * Don't understand why we should maintain cloud-provider specific tests
  * Need a gating PR signal for kubeadm
* [kubeadm-dind-cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubeadm-dind-cluster)
  * K8s 1.11 is now supported
  * Current K8s master support works again
  * multiple-cluster support is in the works
