# 2018-07-11

* SIG introductions or deep-dives at upcoming Kubecon(s)
  * Two sessions in Seattle
* [`kubeadm`] config api graduation to `v1beta1`
  * [Tracking issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/963)
* [`kubeadm`] slower devices (raspberry pi) try to start control plane and time
  out due to aggressively-set timeouts
  * Add as an alpha config and backport?
  * Coefficient on timeouts?
  * Check with `sig-api-machinery` to find out what the apiserver startup time
    should be and if it changes over time.
* [`kubeadm`] What do we support for CRI?
  * Lots of marketing, not a lot of meat
  * `crictl` is a work in progress
    * Nascent
  * Too early to claim we support all the CRIs since we can't use `crictl`
  * Without a lot of basic testing, can't really say how well the different
    runtimes work
  * Problem when folks try different runtimes and then file bugs against
    `kubeadm`
  * `containerd` and `CRI-O` are not yet "first class" with tested support.
    * Would like `containerd` to have broad support in the infrastructure
* `[kubeadm`] testing for Calico, Flannel and Weave
  * Heptio tests for Calico
  * No known status for Weave
  * Trying to be vendor-agnostic, but support only known configurations
    everything else is at-your-own-risk
    * Can add more official support with PRs for test signals/coverage
