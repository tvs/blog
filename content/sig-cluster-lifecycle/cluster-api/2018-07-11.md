# Cluster API

* Significant difference between Cluster and Machine Actuator interfaces
  * What does it mean for a cluster to exist?
    * Typically a composite of many resources rather than a single one
    * Do all resources need to exist?
    * Been generally handling this as a cluster without all resources existing
      as not created - but it makes create method look similar to reconcole.
      Still separates out update from create.
* Bootstrapping AWS provider implementation
  * Existing provider is the OpenShift implementation, but isn't generic enough
  * Is there interest in spinning up an official repo on an AWS impl?
  * Heptio is doing an internal POC on Cluster API with AWS
  * Samsung has a deadline in Oct to get something working w/ AWS
  * Should follow the outline created by @dims for creating new repos
  * Wondering if kube builder can be used to create a new provider
    * Central impl is locked to K8s 1.9 w/ aggregated apiserver, so it's not
      easy to use kube builder
* Update on creating OpenStack repo
  * Took awhile to figure out the process, but now have a template for the next
    repo
  * Need to figure out how to do `clusterctl` for out-of-tree providers
  * Need to decide whether we vendor providers or what else
* Is there a `clusterctl` roadmap for out-of-tree providers?
  * Need an import from providers to register them
  * Could have a temp compy of `clusterctl` in the OpenStack repo
  * Can we follow the `kubectl` plugin model?
* Review of aggregate API Server vs CRDs
  * What things are needed by Cluster API? Original concerns may no longer apply
    to CRDs.
  * Making the decision before cutting to beta is probably prudent
  * Aggregated API servers can create custom subresources (e.g. a `reboot`
    action)
  * Aggregated API can be access directly rather than through the API server's
    aggregation mechanism
  * `apiserver-builder` is sort of abandoned
    * Needs to support 1.10 so that cluster-api can be updated
  * CRDs can have flexible deployment models, e.g. an apiserver that _only_
    enables your custom resource and disables everything else (e.g. core APIs)
    * Decoupled from having to create your own binaries
    * Almost an aggregated API server
  * Since CRDs are easier to maintain and create than AAs, can we use
    `kubebuilder` for `cluster-api-provider-$(cloud)` implementations
    independently of whether the core code is migrated?
* Regular office hours for provider _implementers_
  * Creating a Doodle with options, including options for Eurasia
* Cross-cloud project in CNCF with lots of different cloud providers [cncf.ci](https://cncf.ci)
  * Might be good idea to repurpose some or all of that code into a generic
    Cluster API module that uses it (Terraform-based)
  * Ability to work across providers is clean
  * Would want to modify it to use `kubeadm`
  * [Source Code](https://github.com/crosscloudci/cross-cloud)
    * Contains templates for providers, master templates
  * Just added vSphere support to Cross Cloud
* Thinking about how to support multiple masters with Cluster API
  * Working on it with the ssh provider, but not using upstream controllers yet
  * If we want a machine deployment controller or stateful machine controller
    because they have similar semantics as a stateful set in k8s
  * If they're built upstream, while they have similar extension points as
    the actuators today?
  * Haven't prototyped HA yet
  * Looking at pushing roles into the provider config and using that to drive
    `kubeadm` HA install with [stacked control plane instances](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/high-availability/#stacked-control-plane-nodes)
  * Last looked, HA K8s docs recommends not resizing etcd
    * K8s shouldn't care if etcd resizes underneath as long as it's done
      correctly
